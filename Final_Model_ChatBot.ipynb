      "﻿Invantion of diabetes:The term diabetes was probably coined by Apollonius of Memphis around 250 BC. Diabetes is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425. It was in 1675 that Thomas Willis added the word “'mellitus'” to the word diabetes. This was because of the sweet taste of the urine.\n",

      "what is diabetes:\n",
      "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. \n",
      "Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. \n",
      "Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. \n",
      "Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.\n",
      "Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. \n",
      "Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes”. These terms suggest that someone doesn’t really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.\n",

      "\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes: \n",
      "If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin.\n",
      "Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. \n",
      "Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. \n",
      "People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Type 2 diabetes:\n",
      "If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well.\n",
      "You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.\n",
      "However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people.\n",
      "Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gestational diabetes:\n",
      "Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. \n",
      "Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born.\n",
      "However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\n",

      "For the majority of healthy individuals, normal blood sugar levels are as follows:\n",
      "Between 4.0 to 5.4 mmol/L (72 to 99 mg/dL) when fasting [361]\n",
      "Up to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) 2 hours after eating\n",
      "For people with diabetes, blood sugar level targets are as follows:\n",
      "Before meals : 4 to 7 mmol/L for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes\n",
      "After meals : under 9 mmol/L for people with type 1 diabetes and under 8.5mmol/L for people with type 2 diabetes.\n",

      "Women with diabetes can also have symptoms such as urinary tract infections, yeast infections, and dry, itchy skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes of diabetes:\n",
      "Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.\n",
      "Genes may play a role in some people.\n",
      "It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes of Type 1 diabetes:\n",
      "We know that sugar does not cause type 1 diabetes, nor is it caused by anything else in your lifestyle. \n",
      "In type 1 diabetes, the insulin producing cells in your pancreas are destroyed by your immune system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bliendness in Diabetes:\n",
      "People will go blind, be forced to go on dialysis or have their limbs amputated.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is juvenile diabetes curable:\n",
      "There is no cure for diabetes. Neither type 1 (juvenile onset or insulin-requiring) diabetes or type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes ever goes away.\n",
      "In type 1 diabetes, patients sometimes experience what physicians have come to call a \"honeymoon period\" shortly after the disease is diagnosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Happens to Your Body When You Have Diabetes:\n",
      "When the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body has trouble making good use of the insulin it produces, diabetes may develop, according to the International Diabetes Federation. “The thing is that being insulin dependent is kind of like doing math all day while walking on a tight rope between two high buildings,” said Jeff Dachis, founder and CEO of One Drop, of being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. “Too little insulin, and I die slowly over time due to the complications of diabetes. Too much insulin and I can drop into a coma and die instantly. So, you have to get it right”. Early detection and treatment can reduce the chances of developing further complications of diabetes. There are also diet changes you may make to reduce your risk for diabetes, some of which include avoiding processed and packaged foods, eating more protein, cutting down on sodium, and eating more healthy fats.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventations of diabetes:\n",
      "Weight loss, Healthy eating, Regular exercise Possibly, Diabetes medication or insulin therapy, Blood sugar monitoring\n",
      "Get at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise, such as walking or cycling. Cut saturated and trans fats, along with refined carbohydrates, out of your diet. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Diabetes in pregnancy:\n",
      "Women who’ve never had diabetes can suddenly develop gestational diabetes in pregnancy. Hormones produced by the placenta can make your body more resistant to the effects of insulin.\n",
      "Some women who had diabetes before they conceived carry it with them into pregnancy. This is called pre-gestational diabetes.Gestational diabetes should go away after you deliver, but it does significantly increase your risk for getting diabetes later. About half of women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years of delivery, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Having diabetes during your pregnancy can also lead to complications for your newborn, such as jaundice or breathing problems.If you’re diagnosed with pre-gestational or gestational diabetes, you’ll need special monitoring to prevent complications.

      "Identify yourself. Wear a necklace or bracelet that says you have diabetes, especially if you take insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medication.\n",
      "Schedule a yearly physical exam and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace regular physicals or routine eye exams.\n",
      "Keep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year. Your doctor will likely also recommend the pneumonia vaccine.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends the hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously received this vaccine and you're an adult between ages 19 and 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The CDC advises vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it's right for you.\n",
      "Take care of your teeth. Diabetes may leave you prone to more-serious gum infections. Brush and floss your teeth regularly and schedule recommended dental exams. Consult your dentist right away if your gums bleed or look red or swollen.\n",
      "Pay attention to your feet. Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water, dry them gently, especially between the toes, and moisturize them with lotion. Check your feet every day for blisters, cuts, sores, redness and swelling. Consult your doctor if you have a sore or other foot problem that isn't healing.\n",
      "Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Medication also may be needed.\n",
      "If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications. Talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking or using other types of tobacco.\n",
      "If you drink alcohol, do so responsibly. Alcohol, as well as drink mixers, can cause either high or low blood sugar, depending on how much you drink and if you eat at the same time. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation and always with a meal.\n",

      "The primary test used to diagnose both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is known as the A1C, or glycated hemoglobin, test.This blood test determines your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months. Your doctor may draw your blood or give you a small finger prick.The higher your blood sugar levels have been over the past few months, the higher your A1C level will be. Test results are expressed as a percentage. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes.\n",
      "The A1C test isn’t accurate for people with sickle cell anemia or the sickle cell trait. If you have this condition or trait, then your doctor will have to use a different test.\n",

      "1. Apple Cider Vinegar\n",
      "The primary compound in ACV is acetic acid and is believed to be responsible for many of its health benefits.   There are many evidence-based approaches to using ACV.  Taking 2 tablespoons before bedtime can reduce your morning fasting sugar levels.   Even better, 1-2 tablespoons of ACV taken with meals can decrease the glycemic load of a carbohydrate rich meal.   I generally tell patients to either consume ACV alone, prior to a meal or mix it into salad dressings or teas.  \n",
      "2. Fiber and Barley\n",
      "Eating fiber decreases blood sugar and insulin concentrations.   The recommended amount of fiber is around 30 grams per day.  Most Americans get around 6-8 grams, which is not nearly enough.   While you can take fiber supplements like Metamucil (psylium husk), the best way to reach your goal is to eat your veggies!  Barley is a high-fiber, high-protein grain which has lots of data to support its role in helping improve blood sugar, insulin, cholesterol and general inflammation.  Barley does not requiring soaking and usually can cook in less than 15 minutes on the stove top with just some water and salt. \n",
      "3. Chromium\n",
      "Mainly found in brewer’s yeast, deficiency in chromium impairs the metabolism of glucose.  Evidence supports chromium for lower blood sugar and A1c levels.  Be careful if you have kidney disease with this supplement. \n",
      "4. Zinc\n",
      "Those with diabetes are commonly found to be zinc deficient.  Studies have shown zinc supplementation can reduce blood sugar and A1C, have an antioxidant effect, lower blood sugar and even help treat some of the complications related to diabetes.   Large doses of zinc can inhibit the absorption of other minerals like copper, so be sure to ask for guidance of the appropriate dosing. \n",
      "5. Aloe Vera\n",
      "The sap of aloe vera is known for its laxative effect.  Therefore, make sure to get the juice of the gel! There is increasing evidence for use of the gel, which is the mucilaginous material inside the leaves.  Be sure that any product you buy is free of aloin or anthraquinones to avoid finding yourself in the bathroom!\n",
      "6. Berberine\n",
      "This is one of my all-time favorite botanicals found in plants such as goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape root and Coptis.  Current evidence supports its use for decreasing blood sugar and hba1c. Be aware that this herb can interfere with metabolism of traditional pharmaceuticals and should never be taken while pregnant. \n",
      "7. Cinnamon\n",
      "A medically beneficial indulgence to help lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. \n",
      "8. Fenugreek\n",
      "A seed commonly used as a food spice has been used abroad for centuries for its medical benefits to lower cholesterol and hba1c.  If your urine smells like maple syrup, not to worry, this is a known side effect and is harmless. \n",
      "9. Gymnema\n",
      "Used for centuries in India, evidence is catching up to its medical use showing benefits for glucose metabolism, insulin levels and as an adjunct to improve the results of traditional pharmaceuticals.  Be aware, because this botanical works synergistically with your meds, you must monitor your blood sugar closely to avoid having hypoglycemia. \n",
